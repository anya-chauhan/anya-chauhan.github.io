  <p><em>This project marked my first experience working collaboratively in a team setting, where I took on the dual responsibilities of contributing to all technical aspects and stepping into a leadership role as the Project Management Lead. Balancing technical contributions with coordinating the machine learning subteam taught me the importance of clear communication, adaptability, and the value of diverse perspectives. It was a transformative experience that strengthened my ability to manage projects and contribute meaningfully to a shared vision.</em></p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>  
<blockquote> 
<p style="color: #666;"> 
As Project Management Lead and member of the Machine Learning subteam, I developed an intelligent recommendation system for AI code assistant-related content. The project combined web scraping, natural language processing, and recommendation algorithms to create a sophisticated content discovery tool, starting with Medium articles as our initial data source.
