<blockquote> <p><em> AI Learning Compass grew out of a transformative experience during the AFS program, where I interacted with girls from across the globe. Many were eager to learn about technology and AI but lacked accessible resources. Their curiosity inspired me to create a platform that simplifies complex AI concepts and adapts to diverse learning levels. Drawing on my personal learning strategies and feedback from users across 15 countries, I developed this app to make AI education intuitive, engaging, and inclusive. </em></p> </blockquote>
