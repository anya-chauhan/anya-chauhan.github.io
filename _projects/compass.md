# Project Overview
AI Learning Compass addresses a critical challenge in technology education: making machine learning concepts accessible to diverse learners. By combining interactive knowledge graphs with AI-powered content generation, the platform creates an engaging and intuitive learning environment for exploring artificial intelligence concepts.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Knowledge Graph**: Users can dynamically explore AI concepts through an intuitive visual interface, with the ability to zoom, reposition, and adjust node hierarchies
- **GPT Integration**: Real-time generation of customized content including concept explanations, quizzes, and project ideas tailored to user expertise levels
- **Adaptive Learning**: Content difficulty adjusts based on user feedback and interaction history
- **Universal Knowledge Mapping**: Capability to generate knowledge graphs from custom text or URLs, extending functionality beyond AI education
- **Community-Driven Content**: User rating system helps surface the most valuable explanations and resources

## Technical Implementation
The project overcame several technical challenges:
- Developed robust parsing systems for GPT API responses
- Implemented seamless node interaction and graph navigation
- Created optimized real-time graph updates while maintaining performance
- Balanced static and dynamic content delivery
- Built an intelligent feedback system for content improvement

## Impact & Mission
AI Learning Compass was born from a recognition of the AI diversity crisis, with studies showing significant underrepresentation in the field (only 18% women authors at leading AI conferences and less than 2.5% Black workforce at major tech companies). The platform aims to democratize AI education by:
- Making complex concepts accessible to learners from all backgrounds
- Providing personalized learning paths that adapt to individual needs
- Creating an engaging, interactive environment that encourages exploration
- Contributing to the development of more diverse and inclusive AI teams

## Future Development
Version 2.0 plans include:
- Enhanced prompt engineering for more precise content generation
- Improved text-to-knowledge-graph conversion algorithms
- Advanced personalization features based on learning history
- Offline access capabilities
- Deeper integration of community feedback

## Technologies Used
- R Shiny for web application development
- GPT APIs for dynamic content generation
- Knowledge graph visualization libraries
- Custom parsing and graph manipulation algorithms
