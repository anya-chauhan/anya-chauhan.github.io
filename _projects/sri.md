description: Explored the use of AI-generated cardiac MRI data to train machine learning models. Work addressed issues of data scarcity and patient privacy, evaluating whether models trained exclusively on synthetic data could still perform well on real-world datasets.

<p>From exploring AI in recommender systems to taking a plunge into healthcare, my journey into AI has been both exhilarating and eye-opening. Step 4 of my journey brought me into uncharted territory: using AI for real-world medical applications.</p>

<p><em>This was more than just a technical milestone; it was my first chance to see AI interact with real-world medical challenges.</em></p>

<p>Guided by an amazing mentor at SRI (, I found new layers to AI that I hadn't encountered before. This experience taught me that complexity doesn't always mean improvement, how metrics can sometimes deceive, and the importance of tools like Grad-CAM to understand what our models <em>see</em>.</p>

<p>This project opened the door to my first major research study, titled "<em>Recruiting Digital Patients: The Effectiveness of Training Models on AI-Generated Cardiac MRI Data</em>," with the abstract published in <em>The Young Researcher</em>.</p>

>The Student Research Institute (SRI) by the Harvard Undergraduate OpenBio Laboratory is a virtual summer program to increase access to research for high school students in the natural and physical sciences.
